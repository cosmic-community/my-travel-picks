## Prompts

This application was built using the following prompts to generate the content structure and code:

### Content Model Prompt

> "Create a modern, minimal, and beautiful travel landing page called 'My Travel Picks'.
> The page should display a grid of destination cards. Each card has: a large travel photo, the city name, a short description, and a button 'Book Now' that links to my GetYourGuide affiliate link.
> Add a search bar at the top so users can quickly search for a destination.
> At the top, display my custom travel logo in the header.
> Use clean fonts like Lato or Poppins, rounded corners, soft shadows, and smooth hover animations on the cards.
> The style should feel light, elegant, and perfect for a travel brand.
> Make sure the website is mobile-friendly and optimized for Instagram/TikTok users coming from bio links."

### Code Generation Prompt

> Based on the content model I created for the travel landing page prompt above, now build a complete web application that showcases this content. Include a modern, responsive design with proper navigation, content display, and user-friendly interface.

The app has been tailored to work with your existing Cosmic content structure and includes all the features requested above.
